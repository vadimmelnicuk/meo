# Markdown Editor Optimized (MEO)
Optimized editor for markdown files with live edit mode.

## Features
- Switch between `Live` (clean writing) and `Source` (raw markdown) modes in the single editor tab.
- Format quickly with toolbar actions for headings, lists, tasks, tables, code blocks, links, and quotes.
- In live mode, toggle tasks, open links with `Cmd/Ctrl + Click`, and preview Mermaid diagrams.
- Select text in live mode to open a floating menu for bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code, and links.
- Insert and edit tables directly in the editor.
- Jump through long docs with a heading outline sidebar.
- Toggle file auto-save from the toolbar.

## Usage
- Open a `.md` or `.markdown` file with Markdown Editor Optimized by right-clicking the file in Explorer and selecting `Open With Markdown Editor Optimized`.
- Set it as default by running `Markdown Editor Optimized: Set as Default`.
